# RubikCubeRobot


This project need a LEGO NXT to receive messages via Bluetooth. The NXT is able to solve a Rubik's cube after it carrys out all commands. These source codes in JAVA should be run in an Android phone.

Files were first genrated about 2012-2014. There were some helpful codes found at github, which let phones to communicate with NXT. I also could find helpful codes about Thistlehwaite Algorithm. They were part of my refence codes. I intergated them into my projects. Thanks for these engineers.

Becuse I am going to release my project, I need go back to check codes in my Rubik Robot project. I can still find them in github, for example, https://github.com/MarcProe/nxt-remote-control/blob/master/src/org/jfedor/nxtremotecontrol/NXTTalker.java. You can see I added some codes to allow Rubik Robot to solve a Rubik cube as a whole packege.
